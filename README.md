### Hi there 👋, I'm Rehan Haider! 🌿🦁

Love taking (figurative) black boxes 🗃, breaking them apart, understanding how they work, and optimising 🚀 them. 
I'm an Enterprise Architect by profession, but spend my free time educating computer science to the youth. 

Talk to me about anything on Twitter. 
> PS: My name can potentially translates into "Tulsi Singh" or even "Musk Lion". Yes you are permitted to make fun of it.

### Hi there 👋, I'm Rehan Haider! 🌿🦁

Love taking (figurative) black boxes 🗃, breaking them apart, understanding how they work, and optimising 🚀 them. 
I'm an Enterprise Architect by profession, but spend my free time I collaborate on open source Python projects, and teach computer science to the youth.

Talk to me about anything on Twitter.

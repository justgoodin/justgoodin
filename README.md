### Hi there 👋, I'm Rehan Haider! 🌿🦁

Love taking (figurative) black boxes 🗃, breaking them apart, understanding how they work, and optimising 🚀 them. 
I'm an Enterprise Architect by profession, but spend my free time I collaborate on open source Python projects, and teach computer science to the youth.

If you have an exiting open source project in mind, I'd love to be part of it and contribute. 

Talk to me about anything on Twitter.

### Hi there 👋, I'm Rehan Haider! 🌿🦁

Love taking (figurative) black boxes 🗃, breaking them apart, reassembling them (sometimes successfully) and optimise 🚀 them. 
I'm an Enterprise Architect by profession, in my free time I collaborate on open source projects, and teach computer science to the youth.

If you have an exciting open source project in mind, I'd love to be part of it and contribute. 

Talk to me about anything on Twitter.
